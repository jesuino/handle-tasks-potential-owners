Test Task Listener to change a task potential owners
--

This is a task listener to change a task potential owners.

The task listener will read the process variables to find an user to add and another user to remove from potential owners list.

This is an experimental project so you can modify it and put your own logic in the task listener.

Task Listeners can be registered using the `kie-deployment-structure.xml` file. See the sample BPM Suite project at the root of this repository.
